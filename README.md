# IoT_platform (draft)

Inspired by https://larsbergqvist.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/influxdb-and-grafana-for-sensor-time-series/

This project it to learn and try to build IoT platform, which can fulfill various use cases; for example, sensor data logging and monitoring.
The solution architecture is quite generic for modern applications and can be used for data collection, manipulation, analysis and visualisation in many other domains, such as Telco (e.g. performance management), Finance, etc.
